## 📈 Project Description

In this project, I solved **13 business-driven SQL problems** based on pizza sales data.  
The queries helped in answering questions like:

- Total orders placed
- Total revenue earned
- Most selling pizza
- Pizza size trends
- Revenue distribution
- Time-based ordering behavior

## 🔍 SQL Questions Solved

### 🔹 **Basic Level**:
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed  
2. Calculate the total revenue from sales  
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza  
4. Find the most common pizza size ordered  
5. Top 5 most ordered pizza types by quantity  

### 🔹 **Intermediate Level**:
6. Total quantity per pizza category  
7. Orders distribution by hour  
8. Category-wise distribution of pizzas  
9. Average number of pizzas ordered per day  
10. Top 3 pizza types based on revenue  

### 🔹 **Advanced Level**:
11. Percentage revenue contribution per pizza type  
12. Cumulative revenue over time  
13. Top 3 revenue-generating pizzas in each category

##  Insights Gained

- The **"Large" size** was the most popular among customers.  
- Revenue peaked during **evening hours (6–9 PM)**.  
- Certain pizza types contribute disproportionately to revenue despite fewer orders.  
- The business can benefit from promoting medium-revenue pizzas with high order frequency.
